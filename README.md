This is a tool to enter TCL trades per Craig Peroco (check his YouTube channel).

This is the very first version and there is no guarantee it works or will make money for you.
Hell it might even sell everything you own, bankrupt you, and ruin your family so use at your
own risk.

You have to create a file "config.py" in the same directory that looks like this:

        #config.py
        # Production
        API_KEY = 'your api key'
        API_SECRET = 'your api secret'

        # testnet
        # API_KEY = ''
        # API_SECRET = ''

Also: On line 7 remote testnet=True if you want to use this in production.
